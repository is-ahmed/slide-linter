Problem: How can we determine if a PowerPoint slide presentation is good or bad?

Solutions:
Create an extension that exists inside of google slides and constantly scans the current slide you’re on and lists out potential problems and give a score about the goodness of the slide
Start out with a set of best practices ie don’t make titles too long, don’t put too many words on a single slide, good color contrast, fonts, too many/few colours
Too many animations (distracting), too many pictures, too small/big fonts

Product Backlog:
